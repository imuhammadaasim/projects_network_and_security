# Projects in Networking & Security

## üìå Overview
This repository contains hands-on projects and labs related to **computer networking and security**.  
The projects are designed in a **progressive manner**:  
- Starting with **foundational concepts** such as subnetting, IP addressing, and simple LAN connectivity.  
- Gradually moving toward **advanced networking and security implementations** such as routing protocols, ACLs, firewalls, and security hardening.  

The goal is to document my learning journey step by step and provide practical examples for others exploring **networking and cybersecurity**.

## üìÇ Projects Included

### Beginner-Level Projects
- **Accounts & Delivery Department Network Design** - Basic two-subnet office network with inter-department routing
- **XYZ Company Branch Network Design** - Standalone network infrastructure with VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP services, and wireless integration

### Upcoming (Advanced) Projects
As the repository grows, more advanced topics will be covered, including:  
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) for traffic filtering  
- Dynamic routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP)  
- VLANs and Inter-VLAN routing  
- Firewall configurations & network security policies  
- VPN and secure remote access labs  

Projects will be added **sequentially**, building on the knowledge gained from earlier labs.
