# Accounts & Delivery Department Network Design – Cisco Packet Tracer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a small office network in **Cisco Packet Tracer** connecting two departments:  

- **Accounts Department**  
- **Delivery Department**  

The design follows standard subnetting practices, assigning each department its own subnet. Devices are interconnected using appropriate switches and a router, and connectivity between departments is tested through successful ping responses.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Each department should contain at least 2 PCs.  
- Use an appropriate number of switches and a router for inter-department connectivity.  
- Assign IP addresses based on the given network `192.168.40.0/24`.  
- Divide the network into **2 subnets** using subnetting.  
- Connect all devices with appropriate cables.  
- Test end-to-end connectivity between Accounts and Delivery PCs.

## 🔢 Subnetting Design
The given network address is **192.168.40.0/24**.  
We need **2 subnets**, so we borrow **1 bit**:

- **New Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.128 (/25)`  

### Subnet Allocation
#### Subnet 1 – Accounts Department
- **Network Address:** 192.168.40.0  
- **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.128  
- **Valid Host Range:** 192.168.40.1 – 192.168.40.126  
- **Broadcast Address:** 192.168.40.127  

#### Subnet 2 – Delivery Department
- **Network Address:** 192.168.40.128  
- **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.128  
- **Valid Host Range:** 192.168.40.129 – 192.168.40.254  
- **Broadcast Address:** 192.168.40.255

## 🖥️ Network Topology
**Devices Used:**
- 1 Router (for inter-department communication)  
- 2 Switches (one for each department)  
- 2 PCs in **Accounts Department**  
- 2 PCs in **Delivery Department**  
- Appropriate copper straight-through cables

## 📋 IP Addressing Scheme
| Department | Device           | IP Address     | Subnet Mask       | Gateway       |
|------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Accounts   | PC1              | 192.168.40.10  | 255.255.255.128   | 192.168.40.1 |
| Accounts   | PC2              | 192.168.40.20  | 255.255.255.128   | 192.168.40.1 |
| Accounts   | Router Fa0/0     | 192.168.40.1   | 255.255.255.128   | -             |
| Delivery   | PC3              | 192.168.40.130 | 255.255.255.128   | 192.168.40.129 |
| Delivery   | PC4              | 192.168.40.140 | 255.255.255.128   | 192.168.40.129 |
| Delivery   | Router Fa0/1     | 192.168.40.129 | 255.255.255.128   | -             |

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps
### Router Configuration
```bash
Router> enable
Router# configure terminal

Router(config)# interface fa0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.40.1 255.255.255.128
Router(config-if)# no shutdown

Router(config)# interface fa0/1
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.40.129 255.255.255.128
Router(config-if)# no shutdown


PC Gateway Configuration

Accounts PCs → Gateway: 192.168.40.1

Delivery PCs → Gateway: 192.168.40.129

Testing & Verification

Use the ping command to test connectivity.

Example: From PC3 (Delivery) → ping PC1 (Accounts)
